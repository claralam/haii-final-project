# Final Project for Human-AI Interaction Course (05318)

## Real or Fraudulent Job Classifier

### Description

This is a project created for Human-AI Interaction, where I decided to build a machine learning model that can help detect fraudulent job postings. The app uses a model that uses natural language processing to allow users to input textual data from job postings and returns to the user its prediction.

To help build my NLP model, I used some code from this [spaCy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-text-classification-in-python-using-spacy/).

### Running the application

To run the application:
1. Go to the `app` folder
2. Run the following command: `npm start`
